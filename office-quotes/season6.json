[Jo's dog barks] Come with me.","Michael: What?"],["Gabe: [as Michael and Jo leave] Are you leaving? Oh, am I... should I continue with the investigation? "],["Michael: Are you going to kill me?","Jo: Hahahahahaha. "],["Realtor: [on phone] I just need you to come by later and sign a few forms.","Dwight: Okay.","Realtor: What time works for you? [Dwight looks across the street] Mr. Schrute, what time works?","Dwight: Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it. ","Realtor: But... [Dwight closes phone] "],["Michael: [on Jo's jet] Are we going some place far away? I know you said no questions, but... I have an early dinner that I need to get to... with the Chief of Police."],["Creed: I'm very relieved to learn it wasn't you.","Gabe: All right. Uh, Stan, you're up.","Stanley: It wasn't me.","Gabe: What a rich timbre your voice has. Okay, I am prepared to conclude the investigation. And... you did it. [nods at Andy]","Andy: What? Based on what?","Gabe: Uh, just all the evidence. And it really seems like it was you. Can we all agree to say that it was Andy for now, and sit with it, see how it feels?","Dwight: All right. Sounds good.","Jim: Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.","Andy: Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.","Jim: Really?"],["Jo: Michael.","Michael: I have rights.","Jo: Let's just talk.","Michael: I am not going to tell you anything.","Jo: Honey, you don't seem like your normal self.","Michael: Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.","Jo: Mama Jo knew there was something up.","Michael: Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.","Jo: Oh, I hate that.","Michael: And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.","Jo: Who's Holly?","Michael: Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down."],["Kevin: Well, I think that the real question is: Who is the whistleblower?","Dwight: Oh, just..."],["David Wallace: I may have heard from an old client, and I may have immediately started spreading the news to other clients and potential clients, yeah. But I'm not here to talk about that. I am here to talk about Suck It. Suck it."],["Andy: Gabe, I told you all about the printers. ","Jim: I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.","Pam: Yes, it's totally obvious.","Creed: I think we all can agree that it's either Gabe or Angela. [flips a coin] It's Angela. Get her, boys.","Nick: Hey guys, uh, sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to say goodbye to everyone. Through Teach for America, I'm going to go down to Detroit and teach, uh, inner city kids about computers.","Gabe: Uh, not now.","Nick: Oh yeah, it's just that my friends are in the car waiting, so I thought I would...","Stanley: [quietly] Phyllis, what's this guy's name again?","Phyllis: I don't know, is it Shadow or Garth, it's something weird, I...","Nick: My name is Nick.","Angela: Okay, well, Nick, we're in a meeting.","Nick: Okay, look, I get it, people. I'm the lame IT guy, and everybody hates me.","Jim: Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.","Nick: You called me man? I just said my name just now, did you forget it already?","Jim: No... sport.","Nick: You, you guys have fifteen parties a week, you can't learn my name?","Dwight: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch. ","Nick: Thank you so much for that. I saw all your hard drives, and guess what? [gestures to Ryan] You're not a photographer. [gestures to Kelly] And you definitely can't fit into a size two. Darryl, man, you're on Facebook. Why you been telling people you're not on Facebook? People want to be your friend, man! All right? And you. [points to Andy] This guy, you're the one who told the press. You wrote an e-mail to the editor. I saw it, and I also saw a QuickTime movie of your little printer fire test on your hard drive. This guy's the snitch, he's the snitch. So that's it, check it out. [gives the finger]","Andy: You're going to believe that guy?  "],["Jo: When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me.","Michael: Hmm, hmm.","Jo: I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.","Michael: You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.","Jo: Oh honey, surely you don't want that.","Michael: I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too."],["Dwight: I'm about to buy this building, you know.","Hank: You don't say? I own a one-eighth share in a rental property down in Pittston.","Dwight: Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace."],["Andy: Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?","Phyllis: [points to the ceiling] You deserve it."],["Andy: Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...","Kevin: [offscreen] No, it does not!","Andy: Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.","Angela: It does!"],["Erin: Andy?","Andy: Hey.","Erin: I wanted to say that I think it was very brave of you to go to the press.","Andy: Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.","Erin: Yeah."],["Michael: [to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?"],["Jo: Hey, I appreciate you reading that statement. You looked pretty up there.","Michael: That was fun.","Jo: I hope your rough patch ends soon.","Michael: Thanks. Today helped.","Jo: Well, give me a shout if I can brighten your life.","Michael: Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua. ","Jo: Let me see what I can do. "]]}]}
