Actually, Dwight is not the manager yet.","Jim:  No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.","Dwight:  Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.","Jim:  Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.","Andy:  Tuna... You're completely sane.","Jim:  Thank you.","Andy:  Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?","Jim:  Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?","Kevin:  Do you mean it? Anybody? Are you sure?","Jim:  [while sighing] I suppose I am.","Kevin:  Okay... well what do 'I' want in a manager?... let me see. [walks slowly across the office] what do 'I' want?...","Oscar:  I don't think he meant, that--","Kevin:  So now anyone gets to talk at any times?","Oscar:  Go ahead.","Kevin:  What do 'I' want?... I'm looking for someone... who... [smiles] Everyone is listening to me. [Dwight looks at the camera, annoyed]","Oscar:  Can I say...?","Jim:  Yes.","Oscar:  I think it should be Darryl.","Jim:  Okay.","Dwight:  What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.","Oscar:  Kelly's on your side.","Kelly:  I'm sorry, is that all you think of me? A minority? I am so much more than that. I am a dancer, I'm a singer, I'm a fashion designer.","Andy:  Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.","Ryan:  I want an outsider.","Jim:  Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-","Ryan:  No, I mean an outsider. Like someone on the margins of society, who doesn't see things the way we do, like a homeless person.","Pam:  A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.","Ryan:  No, you're right, Pam, let's just leave him to the welfare system and let that handle it.","Pam:  No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.","Ryan:  Let me guess who you want, Pam. Rachael Ray? The ladies of The View?"],["Ryan:  I got away with... everything, under the last boss, and it wasn't good for me, at all. So, I want guidance. I want leadership. But don't just, like, boss me around, you know? Like, lead me. Lead me... when I'm in the mood... to be led."],["Meredith:  I just want, for once, a smart, professional, decisive, well-hung man in his forties.","Jim:  Hey! Hey! Hey!","Meredith:  Okay, fine. Uhh, the guy with a tiny penis. Are you happy? [sarcastically] Let's hire that guy! [Jim looks speechless]","Andy:  She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.","Gabe:  [walks in] Gotta catch a plane.","Pam:  Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.","Gabe:  Oh, well I'm still the corporate liaison to the branch.","Kelly:  You are not leaving without giving me a hug. [hugs Gabe] Ughh.","Gabe:  Okay, you know what, you don't need to make that sound.","Kelly:  I'm sorry! You were just a lot bonier than I thought you were gonna be!","Gabe:  There are plenty of people who love touching me. [camera zooms to Ryan, who looks at the camera, extremely skeptical] I'm a terrific hugger. I've been with a bunch of girls where that's basically all they want to do. I will see you all soon.","Kevin:  Later, man.","All:  [various] Good luck! Goodbye! Good luck at your new job. ","Ryan:  Take care, man.","Dwight:  We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]","Andy:  [stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.","Erin:  I see it. [nods and smiles] I see it like I see a mountain that I'm standing in front of [voice cracks] and facing, and I'm like...","Phyllis:  Yeah. [Oscar looks confused] Yeah, Andy would be wonderful as boss. Erin made a good point. [brushes Erin's hair with her hand]"],["Phyllis:  No, we're not related. I got the call. But... I'll tell her some other day. [smiles]"],["Jim:  What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?","Angela:  Well, let me be clear. I only speak for myself, and not myself and the Senator. I think we have some wonderful candidates, and there's a great, lively debate here, but let's think about-","Toby:  No, no,... no. Sorry. We cut Kevin off for the same thing. You have to have something to say, if you talk. [Angela rolls her eyes and stops talking]","Kevin:  Exactly.","Darryl:  [enters the office with his daughter, who runs in and hugs Jim] Jada, no, no, no, Jada, what are you doing? [Jim looks knowingly at the camera] Oh. So sorry, guys. I hope my family didn't disrupt your meeting.","Jada:  Daddy, are these the people who are making you manager?","Darryl:  [sighs] Maybe, sweetheart. Single dad. Challenges.","Jada:  I don't know if he'd be a good manager [Jim shakes his head and looks wide-eyed at Darryl], but he's a really great dad!","Darryl:  Okay, shush it. This was a mistake. Let's go. [Darryl and Jada leave, Ryan slowly shakes his head]","Phyllis:  It seems like we all know enough to vote. Should we just vote now?","Jim:  What? No, no, it's not a vote.","Phyllis:  Then what was this all about?","Jim:  I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.","Kelly:  I don't care. They can just vote.","Jim:  No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]"],["Andy:  Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that."],["Nellie:  This job? Oh, yeah, I'll get it. Jo's an old friend. I think... I'm her best friend. She's not my best friend."],["Darryl:  Every day I have a blueberry muffin. Today, I did not have a blueberry muffin. Should have had the blueberry muffin... especially considering how incredibly superstitious I am."],["Fred:  No, I've never been more sure of anything in my life. I will be the new boss of... [looks back to glance at lobby directory] Vance Refrigeration."],["Merv:  Honestly, I think I... I sabotaged myself. It's like I'm afraid of being happy. Case in point... I was supposed to start another job today."],["Robert:  [chuckles] I will get offered the job. That's a... call I've received many times. The slight hopefulness in their voice, the pregnant pause... while they wait to hear my response, and then... my response."],["Finger Lakes Guy:  [geeky voice] I want the job. I really do. It's just, the rest of my family's in the Finger Lakes right now. I'm supposed to be in the Finger Lakes right now. I told them I was on a hike; snuck away to do this interview. I gotta get back pretty soon; they'll worry. People disappear in the Finger Lakes."],["Dwight:  I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]"],["Creed:  You remind me so much of my fourth-biggest client.","Pam:  [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?","Creed:  I think you two should meet.","Pam:  Well, okay!","Creed:  Hey Jordana! Patch my ninth- and fourth-biggest clients together. [Pam puts down phone and picks it back up]","Pam as \"fourth-biggest client\":  [in a comedic male voice] Hello! ","Pam as \"ninth-biggest client\":  [in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!","Pam as \"fourth-biggest client\":  Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]","Pam as \"ninth-biggest client\":  Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!","Pam as \"fourth-biggest client\":  Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!","Creed:  It's Kismet! "]]}]}
