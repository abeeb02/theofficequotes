What you want is a good night's sleep, working mother of two.","Pam: Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?","Nellie: Does Jim have to breastfeed? Did Jim carry around those babies for-- what is it? 12 months? Be honest, does Jim really get up in the night?","Pam: Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.","Nellie: You must be exhausted.
