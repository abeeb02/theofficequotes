","Jim: Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?","Pam: About 2 months","Jim: That’s why it’s so clean. ","Pam: Yeah. ","Jim: I mean, you were gonna do this without me? ","Pam: Well, you… you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you. ","Jim: Oh… okay. Where would we go?","Pam: Austin? Maybe. ","Jim: I promise you, you don’t have to do this for me. ","Pam: I’m doing it for us. ","Jim: The last…","Buyer: Okay. We’ll take it. ","Jim: [to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about…","Pam: Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?","Buyer: We wanna buy your house. ","Jim: You wanna do this?","Pam: I wanna do this. ","Jim: You really want to do this?","Pam: I really want to do this! ","Jim: [hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God! "],["Jim: Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]","Darryl: What? All right! ","Pam: We’re so excited."],["Phyllis: Cool.","Woman: Oh, that’s for PBS executives only.","Stanley: I had to pledge $50 to my local PBS station just to get this. "],["David Wallace: I think your ideas are fantastic, Oscar. I’d love to contribute to your campaign. ","Oscar: Thank you David."],["Pam: Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper…,which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I’ve painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]","Pam: Everyone, Let’s take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just…I kind of meant just everybody from the office. "],["Photographer: [taking pictures] Very nice. Just a couple dozen more. Smiles, everybody, smiles. All right, that’s great. I got enough. Thank you, everybody. "],["Jim: [whispering to Pam] Let’s go outside","Pam: Okay."],["Stanley: Okay, I need a drink.","Kevin: Yeah, we all need a drink. [opening Meredith’s drawer] What the…there’s only dandelion tea and raisins in here.","Meredith: Hey, bottom drawer.","Kevin: Yes!"],["Pam: [answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I’m sorry. Jim Halpert doesn’t work here anymore. "],["Pam: I didn’t watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It’s just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It’d be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I’m a tragic person. I’m really happy now. But…it would just…just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself “be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn’t that long.”"],["Kevin: If there is one thing that I have learned through this whole experience, it’s that if you film anybody long enough, they’re going to do something stupid. It’s only human natural. "],["Dwight: Hey guys.","Angela: Hi.","All: Hey!","Pam: What about the honeymoon? ","Angela: Oh, the honeymoon can wait till tomorrow. We wanted to hang out with you guys. I mean, when are we all going to be here together again? ","Dwight: Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?","Jim: You know what? Maybe we should talk."],["Darryl: Hey, come here. You guys need to see this.","Kevin: What is it?","Andy: [on the computer] You’re probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn..."],["Pam: I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing…","Jim: Athleap.","Pam: And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We’ll come back to visit. But I think it’s time for us to officially…","Dwight: No, don’t say it. You’re fired! You’re both fired!","Jim: Dwight, come on. Don’t end on a bad note.","Dwight: Don’t be an idiot. It’s for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you’ve been here. That’s the max. ","Pam: Thanks Dwight.","Jim: Hey, and if you’re ever in Austin...","Dwight: Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you’re ever in the area, you’ll always have a place to stay…in my barn. ","Jim: There it is."],["Dwight: Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don’t have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So… have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let’s see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So…yes. I’d say I have gotten along with my subordinates."],["Andy: [on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you’re about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.","Kevin: Oh, Yes!","Darryl: You did good. Real good.","Andy: Thanks Dad…Darryl."],["Andy: I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I’m exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I’m still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they’re the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you’re in the good old days before you’ve actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that."],["Oscar: You take something ordinary, like a piece of paper. It’s not much. But if you see it in the right way…And that’s what you did with this documentary. But seriously, you made a nine-year documentary and you couldn’t once show me doing my origami."],["Creed: [walking out of the bathroom discovered by all] Uh..ohh!"],["Creed: [playing guitar and singing] I saw a friend today. It had been a while. And we forgot each others names. But it didn’t matter. ‘Cause deep inside the feeling still remained the same…"],["Jim: Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes…and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that’s…an amazing gift."],["Phyllis: Hey, Jim, remember flonkerton when you did Office Olympics? It was awesome.

[crying] I think I’m gay.","Oscar: Why do you say that?","Kevin: [sniffles] It’s just that I’m so emotional.","Oscar: Yeah, but you’re not gay. You’re not gay.","Kevin: No, but maybe the reason…","Oscar: You’re not gay."],["Creed: [still playing and singing] And all the faces that I know have that same familiar glow. I think I must have known them somewhere once before. "],["Erin: How did you do it? How did you capture what it was really like? How we felt and how made each other laugh and how we got through the day? How did you do it? Also, how do cameras work?"],["Darryl: Everyday when I came into work, all I wanted to do was leave. So why in the world does it feel so hard to leave right now?"],["Creed: It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring. I took a desk at the back because it was empty. But…[chuckles] no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have this miraculous gift to make that place home. [standing with two cops] Let’s do this."],["Meredith: I just feel lucky that I got a chance to share my crummy story with anyone out there who thinks they’re the only one to take a dump in a paper shredder. You’re not alone sister. Let’s get a beer sometime."],["Phyllis: I’m happy that this was all filmed so I can remember everyone and what we did. I worked for a paper company all these years and I never wrote anything down. "],["Jim: I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn’t love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid…wonderful…boring…amazing job."],["Pam: I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all…I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There’s a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn’t that kind of the point?"]]}]}
